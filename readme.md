A collection of tools for the MMORPG Runescape written in PHP.

### Planned Features

Some of these may need two be done twice, once for EoC/RS3 and once for OldSchool.

#### Basic Features

- combat calculator
- highscores lookup
- mini game lookup
- adventures log (would be handy to have direct access to set parts of this - eg `$player->alog->quests()`)
- latest news
- I'd love to pull patch notes from some sort of API, although I don't know of one...

#### Handy Tools

- xp -> level converter
- level -> xp converter
- shorten number (convert 5000 to 5k) - done
- expand number (convert 5k to 5000)
- current player count
