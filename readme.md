A collection of tools for the MMORPG Runescape written in PHP.

### Planned Features

Some of these may need two be done twice, once for EoC/RS3 and once for OldSchool.

#### Basic Features

- Combat calculator
- Highscores lookup
- Mini game lookup
- Adventures log (would be handy to have direct access to set parts of this - eg `$player->alog->quests()`)
- Latest news
- I'd love to pull patch notes from some sort of API, although I don't know of one...

#### Handy Tools

- XP -> level converter
- Level -> XP converter
- Shorten number (convert 5000 to 5k) - done
- Expand number (convert 5k to 5000)
- Current player count
